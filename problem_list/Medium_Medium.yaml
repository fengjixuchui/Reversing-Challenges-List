    Recently, I found an executable binary.
    As I'm a true newbie,
    Certainly, to solve it, I will have difficulties.
    Keep in mind, the first step is quite easy.
    Maybe the last one will be quite tricky.
    Emulating it could be a good idea.
    You must solve steps 1, 2 and 3 first.

    mdZero says that he has tons of excellent tools. However, he has never showed his magic to us before. "They are all stored in my mobile HDD. At home, not here". That's what he told us when we were asking, every time!
    Once, we forced him to tell us, or he would be sent to cops. Then he take out this one from his pocket. Could you help me to figure out what is it?
