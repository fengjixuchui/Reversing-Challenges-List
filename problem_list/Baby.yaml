    Can you help me?
    Recently, I found an executable binary.
    As I'm a true newbie,
    Certainly, to solve it, I will have difficulties.
    Keep in mind, the first step is quite easy.
    Maybe the last one will be quite tricky.
    Emulating it could be a good idea.
    The challenge is available at : http://static.quals.nuitduhack.com/stage1.bin

    You must solve step 1 first.
